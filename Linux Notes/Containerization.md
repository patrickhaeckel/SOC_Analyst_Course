## **Containerization**

- **Definition**: Packaging and running applications in isolated environments called containers.
- **Benefits**: Lightweight, consistent, portable, and scalable.
- **Technologies**: Docker, Docker Compose, Linux Containers (LXC).
- **Difference from VMs**: Containers share the host system’s kernel, making them more efficient.
- **Use case analogy**: Like portable "stage pods" for a concert, providing isolated yet lightweight setups.

### **Security**

- **Isolation**: Containers prevent applications from interfering with each other or the host system.
- **Risks**: Containers have lower isolation than VMs, making privilege escalation or container escapes possible.
- **Mitigation**: Proper configuration and security hardening are necessary.

### **Advantages**

- **Consistency**: Containers encapsulate dependencies, ensuring the same behavior across environments.
- **Efficiency**: Multiple containers can run simultaneously on the same host with minimal overhead.
- **Scalability**: Ideal for microservices and cloud-native applications.

### **Docker**

- **Definition**: Open-source platform for automating application deployment via containers.
- **Key Features**: Layered filesystem, resource isolation, flexibility, and portability.
- **Analogy**: Like a sealed lunchbox—each container is self-contained, and new ones are created from a recipe (Dockerfile).
- **Management Tools**: Kubernetes, Docker Compose for orchestrating multiple containers.

A **Dockerfile** is a script containing a set of instructions that Docker uses to build an image. This image serves as a template for creating containers, which are isolated environments that run specific applications.

In this case, the goal is to create a **file hosting server** inside a Docker container. The container will be based on **Ubuntu 22.04** and will include:

1.  **Apache Web Server** – This allows files to be hosted and downloaded using HTTP.
2.  **SSH Server** – This enables secure file transfer using `scp` (Secure Copy Protocol).

### **Why use Docker for file hosting?**

- Docker containers are lightweight and easy to deploy.
- Apache provides a simple way to serve files over HTTP.
- The SSH server allows secure file transfer (`scp`) to the container.

### **How does it work?**

1.  The Dockerfile starts with Ubuntu 22.04 as the base image.
2.  It installs necessary packages, including Apache, OpenSSH server, and utilities like `curl` and `wget`.
3.  It configures Apache to serve files from a specific directory.
4.  It sets up the SSH server to accept connections.
5.  It exposes relevant ports so that the services can be accessed:
    - **Port 80** (for Apache) to serve files.
    - **Port 22** (for SSH) to transfer files securely.

This setup enables a smooth workflow where you can:

- **Upload files to the container** using `scp`.
- **Download files from the container** using `curl`, `wget`, or a web browser.
